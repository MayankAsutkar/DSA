The primary difference between a stack and a queue lies in their order of data access: stack follows a Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle, while a queue adheres to a First In, First Out (FIFO) principle. In a stack, the most recently added item is the first to be removed, whereas in a queue, the first item added is the first to be removed.


Stack (LIFO)
Insertion and Deletion: Both insertion (push) and deletion (pop) operations occur at the same end, called the "top". 
Order: The last element added to the stack is the first one removed, hence the LIFO principle. 
Examples: Function call stack, undo/redo operations. 


Queue (FIFO)
Insertion and Deletion: Insertion (enqueue) occurs at the "rear" end, and deletion (dequeue) occurs at the "front" end. 
Order: The first element added to the queue is the first one removed, adhering to the FIFO principle. 
Examples: Printer spooling, managing requests in a web server.
