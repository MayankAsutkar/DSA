/*
    A heap is a data structure that can be represented as a complete binary tree or in array form.
    It is a useful data structure for sorting algorithms, priority queues, and autocomplete and caching mechanisms.
    There are two types of heaps: Max Heap and Min Heap. In a Max Heap, the children nodes have values that are less than or equal to the value of the parent node, while in a Min Heap, the children nodes have values that are greater than or equal to the value of the parent node.
    A heap can be represented as both a tree and an array.\

    Binary Heap:
        A binary heap is a complete binary tree that respects the heap property.

    Heap Property:
        Each node is smaller than or equal to it's children if it's a min heap or greater than or equal to it's chilren if it's a max heap.
